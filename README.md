# problems 
The most consistent problem is trying to get all of the different list formats to play nice.
All formatting is different for most of the pages, sometimes the links need to be concatenated and other times split into an array.
Thinking about designing test cases in order to better narrow down the problem areas.  Also need to refactor in to smaller helper functions 
in order to gain better clarity.  Good news is that the post route is working.  Need a put route to edit soon.

# to do
Make get routes with paging
Make tests for list splitting and concatenation
Refactor to smaller more manageable functions
